Hyperparameter optimization is a process of finding the right combination of hyperparameter values in order to achieve maximum performance on the data in a reasonable amount of time. Hyperparameter optimization can be represented in simple equation form as:

Here f(x) represents an objective score to minimize— such as RMSE or error rate— evaluated on the validation set; x* is the set of hyperparameters that yields the lowest value of the score, and x can take on any value in the domain X.
