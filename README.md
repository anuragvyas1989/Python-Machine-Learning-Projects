# Machine Learning Using Python

Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. **Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs** that can access data and use it learn for themselves. <br>

### [Gender Voice Recognition by Voice and Speech analysis](https://github.com/anuragvyas1989/Python-Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Gender%20Voice%20Recognition%20by%20Voice%20and%20Speech%20analysis)
![enter image description here](https://github.com/anuragvyas1989/Python-Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Images/Speech%20Recognition.jpg)<br>
- Algorithm to understand and __classify__ if a person is male or female based on voice pattern
- This can be first step to further identify and develop an AI model for speech recognition

### [House Sale Price Calculation](https://github.com/anuragvyas1989/Python-Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/House%20Sale%20Price%20Calculation)
![enter image description here](https://github.com/anuragvyas1989/Python-Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Images/House%20Price.jpg)<br>
- __Sale Price of a house__ depends on a number of __features of the house__ ranging from the Plot area to the garage area.
- House Features can be both __qualitative as well as quantitative__. Thus requiring a deeper understanding of the data.
- An effort to build a model which can closely predict the price of the house.

### [Market Basket analysis on Groceries Data](https://github.com/anuragvyas1989/Python-Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Market%20Basket%20analysis%20on%20Groceries%20Data)
![enter image description here](https://github.com/anuragvyas1989/Python-Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Images/Groceries.jpg)<br>
- **Market Basket Analysis** is done by organizations so as to get itemsets that are frequent and regularly utilized together by customers. **Apriori algorithm** is a generally utilized system so as to discover those combinations of itemsets.
- It identifies parts which are often bought together and hence can be recommended to the user or be placed accordingly.

### [Content Based Recommendation System](https://github.com/anuragvyas1989/Python-Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Content%20Based%20Recommendation%20System)

- Content-based filtering uses item features to recommend other items similar to what the user likes, based on their previous actions or explicit feedback.
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Fequency is used in this example to calculate the frequency and find the cosine similarity between various items
